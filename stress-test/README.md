# Ledger Stress Test

This directory contains k6 gRPC smoke, write, and query stress tests and is not
a Maven or Spring module. The smoke verifies one dependent workflow:

1. `PostService/postTransaction`
2. `PostService/getTxnByRefId`
3. `PostService/getTxnById`

The transaction reference is unique per run. Both query calls validate the
transaction created by the write call and require the two ledger entries.

The write stress test exercises `postTransaction` with open arrival-rate
profiles for capacity discovery, overload recovery, and stable-load soak. See
`doc/stress-test/ledger-write-stress-test-operations.md` for its commands,
configuration, metrics, and reconciliation flow.

The query stress test exercises `getTxnById` and `getTxnByRefId` separately
with `includeEntries=true`. Its RPC-discovery, working-set-discovery, and soak
profiles keep load and data-cardinality experiments isolated. See
`doc/stress-test/ledger-query-stress-test-flow.md` and
`doc/stress-test/ledger-query-stress-test-operations.md`.

## Fixture Provisioning

`run-smoke.sh` connects directly to the ledger MySQL database before starting
k6 and applies `fixtures/ledger-smoke-fixture.sql`. The SQL idempotently creates
these dedicated rows:

| Fixture | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Asset ID | `k6-smoke-asset` |
| Account ID | `k6-smoke-account-id` |
| Account reference | `k6-smoke-account` |

Fixture setup is completed before k6 starts, so it is excluded from gRPC
latency. Run this only against a test database. The database credentials must
permit `INSERT` and `UPDATE` on `assets` and `accounts`.

Write and query stress runners can start from an empty ledger database by
setting `LEDGER_STRESS_TRUNCATE_DB_BEFORE_RUN=true`. It defaults to `false`.
This deletes all rows from ledger-service tables, including outbox data, before
fixtures are applied. Use it only on isolated test infrastructure; the MySQL
user also needs the `DROP` privilege required by `TRUNCATE TABLE`.

## Run With Docker

From the repository root:

```bash
COMPOSE_MENU=false COMPOSE_ANSI=never \
docker compose --progress plain \
  -f deploy/docker-compose.stress-test.yml up --build \
  --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from stress-test
```

For the AWS VPC deployment, provide the same database settings used by
ledger-service:

```bash
INFRA_PRIVATE_IP=172.31.18.211 \
LEDGER_GRPC_HOST=172.31.16.37 \
LEDGER_DB_USERNAME=ledger \
LEDGER_DB_PASSWORD='replace-with-the-infrastructure-value' \
COMPOSE_MENU=false COMPOSE_ANSI=never \
docker compose --progress plain \
  -f deploy/docker-compose.stress-test.yml up --build \
  --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from stress-test
```

`COMPOSE_MENU` and `COMPOSE_ANSI` control the host-side Compose terminal UI.
Disabling them prevents the `Enable Watch / Detach` menu and ANSI redraws from
overwriting the k6 summary. `--progress plain` also keeps image-build output
line-oriented.

`LEDGER_GRPC_HOST` overrides the gRPC target directly. If it is not set, the
Compose default is `172.31.16.37`.

Run the standalone query workload with:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.ledger-query-stress-test.yml up --build \
  --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from ledger-query-stress-test
```

Set `LEDGER_QUERY_PROFILE`, `LEDGER_QUERY_LOOKUP`, and a unique
`LEDGER_QUERY_RUN_ID` before running. The complete configuration is documented
in `doc/stress-test/ledger-query-stress-test-operations.md`.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LEDGER_GRPC_HOST` | `172.31.16.37` | Ledger gRPC host |
| `LEDGER_GRPC_PORT` | `9191` | Ledger gRPC port |
| `LEDGER_GRPC_DEADLINE_SECONDS` | `5` | Connection timeout, per-RPC timeout, and latency threshold |
| `LEDGER_TEST_AMOUNT` | `100` | Debit and credit amount; passed as protobuf `int64` |
| `INFRA_PRIVATE_IP` | `172.31.18.211` | Fixture database host |
| `DB_PORT` | `3306` | Fixture database port |
| `LEDGER_DB_NAME` | `trade_ledgerservice` | Ledger schema |
| `LEDGER_DB_USERNAME` | `ledger` | Fixture database user |
| `LEDGER_DB_PASSWORD` | `ledger-local` | Fixture database password |
| `DB_READY_ATTEMPTS` | `30` | Two-second database readiness attempts |
| `DB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `5` | Maximum duration of each database connection attempt |
| `K6_OUT` | `experimental-prometheus-rw` | Streams granular k6 metrics to Prometheus during the run |
| `K6_PROMETHEUS_RW_SERVER_URL` | `http://172.31.28.170:9290/api/v1/write` | Prometheus remote-write receiver on the monitoring EC2 |
| `K6_PROMETHEUS_RW_TREND_STATS` | `p(95),p(99),max` | Trend series retained for the provisioned stress dashboard |

The load-generator EC2 requires outbound VPC access to:

- ledger EC2 port `9191`
- infrastructure EC2 port `3306`
- monitoring EC2 port `9290`

No inbound port is required on the load-generator EC2.
