# Kafka Listener Refactor Test Cases

## Scope

These cases cover the behavior described in
`codex/kafka/listener-refactor/feature/kafka-listener-refactor-change-scope.md`,
especially section `6. Scenario Behavior`, plus additional cases found in the
current `common-util` and `ledger-service` implementation.

This document is the test design blueprint for the unit tests implemented in
this phase. Spring Kafka broker/retry-topic integration tests remain optional
and are intentionally skipped for now.

## Test Layers

- `common-util` unit tests:
  - `DefaultListener`
  - `KafkaHeaderListenerAttemptResolver`
  - `OutboxRepository.insertWithClaimAndVerify`
  - default `MessageHandler` adapters
- `ledger-service` unit tests:
  - `LedgerCommandMessageHandler`
  - `LedgerFailureReplyFactory`
  - `LedgerListenerRetryProperties`
  - ledger common listener config wiring by reflection
- Optional Spring Kafka integration tests:
  - retry-topic routing
  - DLT handler invocation

## Shared Test Fixtures

Use stable fixture names so all tests assert the same business contract:

| Fixture | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `requestEventId` | `wallet-event-123` |
| `commandId` | `wallet-command-123` |
| `successReplyEventId` | `reply:wallet-event-123:success` |
| `serializeErrorReplyEventId` | `reply:wallet-event-123:error:ledger:serialize_error` |
| `internalErrorReplyEventId` | `reply:wallet-event-123:error:ledger:internal_error` |
| `ackFailedHeader` | `zx-ack-failed` |
| `replyFailureAfterAttempts` | `5` |
| `retryTopicAttempts` | `7` |

Mock dependencies for `DefaultListener`:

- `MessageHandler`
- `OutboxRepository`
- `IPublisher`
- `ListenerAttemptResolver`
- `Acknowledgment`
- `Headers`

## Optional Spring Kafka Integration Tests

### KL-IT-001: DlqException Routes Directly To DLT

- original record is routed to `{originalTopic}.dlq`
- DLT handler receives the DLT record
- DLT record includes exception metadata headers

### KL-IT-002: KafkaListenerRetriableException Uses Retry Topics

Given the listener throws `KafkaListenerRetriableException`.

Expect:

- message is published to retry topic
- retry attempt headers increment across retry topics
- listener sees attempt values through `ListenerAttemptResolver`
- when attempts are exhausted and no durable reply exists, Spring routes to DLT

### KL-IT-003: Failed Reply Threshold Is Independent From Final DLT Ceiling

And business keeps throwing retryable failure.

Expect:

- attempts 1 to 4 retry without failed reply
- attempt 5 tries to persist failed reply
- if failed reply insert succeeds, source message is acked and no DLT occurs
- if failed reply insert keeps failing retryably, retries continue until Spring
  retry-topic attempts are exhausted and then DLT occurs

## Recommended First Implementation Batch

Start with unit tests that do not require Kafka broker infrastructure:

1. `DefaultListener` orchestration tests `KL-DL-001` to `KL-DL-022`.
2. `KafkaHeaderListenerAttemptResolver` tests `KL-AR-001` to `KL-AR-006`.
3. Ledger handler/factory tests `KL-LH-001` to `KL-LH-009`.
4. Config/reflection tests `KL-CFG-001` to `KL-CFG-003` and `KL-CFG-006`.

Add embedded Kafka integration tests later only if the team wants executable
proof of Spring retry-topic and DLT routing behavior.
